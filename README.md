# BookClub-App

BookClub is a web and IOS application that allows for the buying, selling, and trading of textbooks. With an account, users will be able to upload and manage books they have for sale. The Cordova framework on the front end allows for cross-platform development using Angular and Typescript, and efficiently wraps the project in production level builds allowing for code re-use between platforms. The Node.js and Express API written in JavaScript connects to and queries MariaDB, which contains the database holding all user and book data. The main goal of the BookClub application is to provide a user-friendly experience and create an easy way to sell old textbooks or buy new ones from peers.

# BookClub-BackEnd

This is the back end of the Book Club Application. It connects with MariaDB to handle all the queries from the front end and send it back to the front end to display the results.
